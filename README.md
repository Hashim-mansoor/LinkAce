## Website Development

The website is build using Jekyll. To start with the development, [install Jekyll locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Then run the following command to start the Jekyll server which publishes your current website and watches for 
file changes automatically:

```bash
jekyll serve
```
